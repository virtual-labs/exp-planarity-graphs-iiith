#### Step 1: Getting Started with the Simulation

1. **Access the Graph Selection Interface**: Locate the dropdown menu labeled "Select a graph to explore" in the top section of the simulation.

2. **Choose Your First Graph**: Select one of the available graph types:
   - **Complete Graph K₄**: A graph with 4 vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex
   - **Complete Graph K₅**: A graph with 5 vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex
   - **Complete Bipartite K₃,₃**: A graph with 6 vertices arranged in two groups of 3, where each vertex in one group connects to all vertices in the other group
   - **Cube Graph**: A graph representing the vertices and edges of a three-dimensional cube
   - **Random Graph**: A randomly generated graph with customizable parameters

3. **Initial Graph Display**: Once selected, the graph will appear on the canvas with vertices represented as blue circles and edges as gray lines connecting them.

#### Step 2: Understanding the Interface Components

1. **Main Canvas Area**: The large white area on the left displays the interactive graph where you can manipulate vertex positions.

2. **Learning Guide Panel**: The right sidebar shows real-time feedback and learning insights as you interact with the graph.

3. **Control Buttons**: Located below the graph selection dropdown:
   - **Check Planarity**: Analyzes the current graph layout for edge crossings
   - **Get Hint**: Provides strategic guidance for arranging vertices
   - **Show Solution**: Displays step-by-step instructions for planar graphs
   - **New Random Graph**: Generates a new random graph configuration
   - **Reset Positions**: Restores vertices to their original positions

4. **Crossing Detection Display**: Shows the current number of edge crossings with a visual progress bar.

5. **Floating Control Panels**: Two circular buttons in the bottom-right corner provide:
   - **Graph Parameters Panel**: Adjust vertex count and edge density for random graphs
   - **Information Panel**: Quick reference for planar and non-planar graph properties

#### Step 3: Exploring Graph Planarity

1. **Initial Analysis**: After selecting a graph, observe the initial layout and note any edge crossings (highlighted in red).

2. **Vertex Manipulation**:
   - Click and drag any vertex (blue circle) to reposition it on the canvas
   - Watch how edge crossings change as you move vertices
   - The Learning Guide will provide feedback on your actions

3. **Using the Check Planarity Function**:
   - Click the "Check Planarity" button to analyze the current layout
   - The system will count and highlight all edge crossings
   - Feedback will appear indicating whether the current arrangement is planar

4. **Iterative Improvement Process**:
   - Continue repositioning vertices to minimize crossings
   - Use the crossing counter to track your progress
   - Pay attention to the feedback messages for guidance

#### Step 4: Learning Through Different Graph Types

1. **Start with K₄ (Recommended for Beginners)**:
   - This graph is guaranteed to be planar
   - Practice dragging vertices to find a crossing-free arrangement
   - Typical successful arrangements include square or triangular layouts

2. **Progress to Cube Graph**:
   - More challenging but still planar
   - Think about unfolding a three-dimensional cube into a flat surface
   - Focus on creating an outer cycle with internal connections

3. **Attempt K₅ and K₃,₃ (Advanced Challenge)**:
   - These are mathematically proven to be non-planar
   - No matter how you arrange the vertices, crossings will always remain
   - Use these to understand the limitations of planar graph drawing

4. **Experiment with Random Graphs**:
   - Use the Graph Parameters panel to adjust complexity
   - Try different vertex counts (5-8 vertices) and edge densities (0.3-0.8)
   - Generate multiple random graphs to practice planarity testing

#### Step 5: Utilizing Advanced Features

1. **Getting Strategic Hints**:
   - Click "Get Hint" when stuck on a particular graph
   - Hints provide specific strategies for each graph type
   - Use hints sparingly to develop independent problem-solving skills

2. **Following Step-by-Step Solutions**:
   - For planar graphs, click "Show Solution" to access guided instruction
   - The solution panel will appear with numbered steps
   - Use "Next" and "Previous" buttons to navigate through the solution process
   - Each step includes visual guidance and explanatory text

3. **Monitoring Learning Progress**:
   - Watch the Learning Guide panel for real-time feedback
   - Track your attempts, successes, and improvements
   - Clear the learning trace using the "Clear" button when starting fresh

4. **Understanding Success Indicators**:
   - A celebration overlay appears when you successfully create a planar layout
   - Success messages differentiate between known planar graphs and random successes
   - Use success moments to solidify your understanding of planar arrangements

#### Step 6: Systematic Exploration Process

1. **Methodical Approach**:
   - Begin with the outer boundary vertices
   - Work inward to position interior vertices
   - Consider symmetrical arrangements for better results

2. **Edge Crossing Analysis**:
   - Focus on edges that frequently cross others
   - Try repositioning the endpoints of problematic edges
   - Look for alternative paths that avoid intersections

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - Notice common planar arrangements (cycles, trees, wheels)
   - Identify non-planar substructures within larger graphs
   - Develop intuition for recognizing planarity potential

4. **Comparative Learning**:
   - Switch between different graph types to compare difficulty levels
   - Note the differences in strategy required for each graph family
   - Build understanding of why certain graphs cannot be made planar

#### Step 7: Consolidating Understanding

1. **Practice Multiple Attempts**: Reset graph positions frequently to practice finding planar layouts from different starting configurations.

2. **Parameter Experimentation**: For random graphs, systematically vary the vertex count and edge density to understand how these factors affect planarity.

3. **Theoretical Connection**: Use the information panels to connect your hands-on experience with the mathematical theory of planar graphs.

4. **Challenge Progression**: Move from simple graphs to more complex ones as your understanding develops.
